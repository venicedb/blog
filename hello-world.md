Welcome to the official blog of the [Venice](https://github.com/linkedin/venice) project.

The goal of this blog is to fill in the gaps in and around the other official resources of the project:

* The [documentation](https://venicedb.org) contains information that is intended to be long-lived, reflective of the latest state of the project, and relevant to the community at large
    
* The [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/company/venicedb) and [Twitter handle](http://twitter.com/VeniceDataBase) are to share interesting tidbits and links
    
* The [Slack workspace](http://slack.venicedb.org) (archived on [Linen](http://linen.venicedb.org)) and [LinkedIn group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14129519/) are for the community to interact together
    
* The [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@VeniceDB) contains original videos, as well as [playlists](https://youtube.com/@VeniceDB/playlists) of other videos published by other channels
    

In this blog, we aim to share such things as:

* The motivations behind certain functionalities, design choices, or upcoming changes
    
* The Venice use cases built by the community
    
* The tradeoffs between Venice and other similar systems
    
* And general news about the project, releases or process changes
